# Shared LGS1920 project rules

Read this shared baseline before the project-specific `PROJECT_RULES.md`.

## Common directives

- Conversational responses must be in French.
- Code comments, JSDoc, technical documentation, and issue content must be in professional English.
- Keep changes within the requested project scope and preserve unrelated work.
- Make routine reversible decisions from repository conventions and evidence. Ask only when missing information materially changes behavior, scope, an external contract, or an approval requirement.
- Never reset, discard, overwrite, or delete user work without explicit authorization.
- Do not automatically stage or commit changes. Stage and create a commit only
  when the user explicitly requests a commit. Push, publish, deploy, and
  release actions also require an explicit request.
- Do not use semicolons in new or modified source code.
- Use arrow functions for functions, except class constructors.
- Keep new files focused and below 1500 lines.

## Quality

- Add deterministic regression coverage for every behavior change at the public boundary.
- Restore timers, DOM globals, observers, event listeners, mocks, and other process-wide state during test cleanup.
- Validate focused checks first, then the repository checks that cover the changed behavior.
- Keep implementation documentation aligned with the behavior that is actually implemented.
